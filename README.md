# A PyTorch implementation of a YOLO v3 Object Detector

## Requirements
1. Python 3.5
2. OpenCV
3. PyTorch 0.4

Using PyTorch 0.3 will break the detector.



"We need to have yolov3.weights file before run this code." 
<br>
and you must download this => https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights  =>and move into Gwangju-Hackathon folder
