# A PyTorch implementation of a YOLO v3 Object Detector

## Requirements
1. Python 3.5
2. OpenCV
3. PyTorch 0.4

"We need to have yolov3.weights file before run this code." 
<br>
and you must download this => https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights  =>and move into Gwangju-Hackathon folder 
<br>
"origin_source code link - https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3"
<br>
run => python cam_demo.py 
<br>
